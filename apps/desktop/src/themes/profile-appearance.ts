/**
 * A profile's appearance as its config.yaml records it (`desktop.theme`,
 * `desktop.theme_mode`).
 *
 * localStorage is per origin, so a pick that lived only there never reached the
 * Webapp (another origin) or another Desktop on the same profile. The backend
 * is now the authority and localStorage the cache the boot paint reads: the
 * config load publishes here, ThemeProvider adopts it for the profile it
 * paints, and a pick writes back through `saveProfileAppearance`.
 *
 * A profile name belongs to ONE gateway, so every read, write and piece of
 * bookkeeping here is keyed by its owner: (connection, profile), captured
 * synchronously when the read or pick happens. A queued write therefore still
 * lands on the gateway it was picked on after the window switches to another.
 *
 * Reads race writes, so every read is stamped on one clock with every local
 * change: a published value speaks for the backend only when its GET began
 * after the owner's last local change and no write for it is in flight. A
 * slower, older GET can never snap a fresh pick back. Writes race each other,
 * so an owner's writes go out one at a time in pick order: the newest pick is
 * always the last PUT to land.
