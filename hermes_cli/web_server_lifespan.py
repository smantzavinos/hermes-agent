    The desktop spawns a ``hermes dashboard`` backend, not a gateway, so without

    per-profile pool (reaped after ~10 idle minutes), so it ticks EVERY local

    single-store behavior (registries are not profile-scoped). Cross-process

    desktop pools per-profile backends and reaps them after ~10 idle minutes, so a secondary profile's
    ticker dies with its backend and that profile's jobs silently stop firing until the user next opens it
